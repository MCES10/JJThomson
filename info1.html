          Sir Joseph John Thomson OM FRS[1] (18 December 1856 â€“ 30 August 1940) was a British physicist and Nobel Laureate in Physics, credited with the discovery of the electron, the first subatomic particle to be found.

          He was born in 1856, 18th December. He was well... British, and was born on Cheetam Hill

        Beginning in 1882, women could attend demonstrations and lectures at the University of Cambridge. Rose attended demonstrations and lectures, among them Thomson's, leading to their relationship.[15]
        They had two children: George Paget Thomson, who was also awarded a Nobel Prize for his work on the wave properties of the electron, and Joan Paget Thomson (later Charnock),[16] who became an author, writing children's books, non-fiction and biographies.[17]
